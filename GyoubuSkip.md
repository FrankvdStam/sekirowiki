# Gyoubu Skip

Gyoubu Skip (also known as Horse Skip) is the name for any skip that bypasses [Gyoubu](/Gyoubu-Oniwa) without fighting him. This is usually used in speedruns that permit glitches. There are several versions of the skip, with the most known one being the tower jump method.

## Tower Jump Version

This is the most common version of the skip and is the standard for most Speedruns.

## Mist Raven Version

This is a lesser known version that is used in some NG+ runs. You use On-Demand Mist Raven to get boosted upwards, then cancel the falling animation by blocking mid-air before immediately cancelling the block animation with a ledge grab, after which you can wall jump earlier than intended and reach up to grab-able ledge.

In February 2025, SaraToga figured out that you can cancel the mid-air block animation early with a ledge grab. Prior to this, we would simply cancel the Mist Raven fall animation by blocking and then wait to be able to wall jump. Because The height you get from using Mist Raven vertically varies seemingly randomly, the skip would only work if you got a tall Mist Raven height. With a short height, you would lose too much height before being able to walljump.

## Firecrackers Stagger Into Headstomp Version
This is the earliest documented version of the skip.
